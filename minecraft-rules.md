# Minecraft Server Rules
- PVP is enabled in the survival Overworld, the Nether and The End! Do not attack people within their claims unless agreed upon. PVP outside of claims is at your own risk.
- No excessive and unnecessary griefing allowed!  We use land claims to protect against and minimize griefing and raiding; however, **ANY UNCLAIMED LAND IS FAIR GAME**; if you donâ€™t claim it, it is owned by the community and is free to anyone. (However, to help clarify, building a 200 meter high wall out of dirt right next to someone's well-designed base is _unnecessary griefing!_  Server administrators and moderators have final decision authority on what constitutes excessive or unnecessary griefing.)
- Do not bring in real world issues, politics or identities into the game.
- No lag machines, item duplication, or lava casts are allowed.
- Anything that gives players an unfair advantage over others is not allowed. (No cheats or exploits!)
- All public communication will be in English.
- End user license agreement from [Mojang](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) always applies to Minecraft related activity. See their link for more info.

- Failure to follow these rules may result in an immediate kick from the server or a permanent ban, depending on the severity of the action, as determined by the moderator performing the action.

# Server Configuration
- **Spawn Protection** is currently set to **`16 blocks`** (which means you will not be able to break blocks within this spawn area)
- **Difficulty** is set to **`hard`**
- **Max World Size** is currently set to **`50000`** (100,000 x 100,000 world border)

# Land Claim Info
- **`2000`** claim blocks are automatically granted to new players
- **`200`** new claim blocks are gained per hour of player activity
- **`80000`** is the maximum number of claim blocks allowed to be accrued, unless claims are granted by an admin
- Placing a chest on unclaimed ground grants you a one-time **automatic land claim** with a **`4 block radius`**
- Claims extend from Bedrock to the Build Limit (note: this is different than the default GriefPrevention behavior which allows you to tunnel under another players claim by default.)
- Minimum claim width is **`5 blocks`**
- Minimum claim area is **`100 blocks`**
- Claim inspection tool is a **`Stick`**  (Use to see who owns a block)
- Claim modification tool is a **`Golden Shovel`**  (Use to adjust a claim size)
- Maximum number of different claims per player is **`25`**
- Inactivity after **`45 days`** will result in a claim loss, this is to prevent inactive bases from taking up space and resources.
- The small, one-time automatic chest claims expire after **`21`** days unless claim is expanded
- Unused claim blocks expire after **`120`** days
- Land claim ability is enabled in The Overworld and The Nether, but not The End.
- Note: view the **[GriefPrevention Info Page](https://crispylegumes.com/grief-prevention-info.html)** for more details on this feature including a list of commands available

# Be Nice!
- Please don't build right next to spawn... you literally have millions of other places to choose from.
- Please don't spawn-camp new players... at least give them a fighting chance!
- Please join the Discord server to extend communication outside of Minecraft chat.
