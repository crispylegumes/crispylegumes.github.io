# Minecraft Custom Server Settings

## Server Properties
- **Spawn Protection** is currently set to **`34 blocks`** (which means you will not be able to break blocks within this spawn area, currently lined with quartz-block.)
- **Difficulty** is set to **`hard`**
- **Max World Size** is currently set to **`50000`** (100,000 x 100,000 world border)

## Minecraft Plugins Utilized
- **GriefPrevention**: The world is a PVP world, allowing for player combat and it is also an open world.  However, GriefProtection is enabled to help protect your stuff by claiming land blocks.
  - Once blocks are claimed, they are nearly impossible to be griefed by other players.
  - If you leave a chest unprotected in your mine, then it's fair game for anyone to clear out.
  - You can always unclaim your land and move your stuff to a different location.
- Some other miscellaneous plugins are installed for server management usage, including EssentialsX, LuckPerms, and Vault.

## Land Claim Info
- **`2000`** claim blocks are automatically granted to new players
- **`100`** new claim blocks are gained per hour of player activity
- **`80000`** is the maximum number of claim blocks allowed to be accrued, unless claims are granted by an admin
- Placing a chest on unclaimed ground grants you a one-time **automatic land claim** with a **`4 block radius`**
- Claims extend from Bedrock to the Build Limit (note: this is different than the default GriefPrevention behavior which allows you to tunnel under another players claim by default.)
- Minimum claim width is **`5 blocks`**
- Minimum claim area is **`100 blocks`**
- Claim inspection tool is a **`Stick`**  (Use to see who owns a block)
- Claim modification tool is a **`Golden Shovel`**  (Use to adjust a claim size)
- Maximum number of different claims per player is **`25`**
- Inactivity after **`45 days`** will result in a claim loss, this is to prevent inactive bases from taking up space and resources.
- The small, one-time automatic chest claims expire after **`21`** days unless claim is expanded
- Unused claim blocks expire after **`120`** days
- Land claim ability is enabled in The Overworld and The Nether, but not The End.
- Note: view the **[GriefPrevention Info Page](https://crispylegumes.com/grief-prevention-info.html)** for more details on this feature including a list of commands available
