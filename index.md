## Hello and Welcome from Crispy Legumes!

Chill your beans live on **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/crispylegumes)**, connect on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CrispyLegumes)** and **[Facebook](https://facebook.com/crispylegumes)** and you should certainly come play **Minecraft** on a Survival PVP world with **GriefPrevention** enabled (with 2,000 claim blocks automatically granted for all new players.)  The world was just started on April 18, 2021 so there is plenty of growth available.

### How To Join My Minecraft World
Hostname for experts: **`minecraft.crispylegumes.com`**

Quick notes for others: The server currently only supports Java clients running the latest client, 1.16.5. You can start your Minecraft game client and click the `Multiplayer` button, and then click on the `Add Server` button to bring up a new screen.  In the **Server Name** edit box type in something like **`Crispy's Server`**, and in the **Server Address** type in **`minecraft.crispylegumes.com`**.  Click on the `Done` button and you'll have a new option defined to connect to my Minecraft Server!  Note: the server utilizes a **Dedicated IP Address** so you do not need to add the port number at the end. (But no worries - you'll still be able to connect if you add the port number like this: **`minecraft.crispylegumes.com:25565`**  Either way is cool!)

### Player Voting
